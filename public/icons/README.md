# App Icons

This directory should contain the following PWA icons:

- `icon-192x192.png` - 192x192 pixel app icon
- `icon-512x512.png` - 512x512 pixel app icon

These icons are referenced in the `manifest.json` file and will be used when users install FeedFlow as a PWA on their devices.

You can generate these icons from a single high-resolution source image using online PWA icon generators or design tools.
